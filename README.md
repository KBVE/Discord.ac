# [Discord.ac - Another Discord Channel](https://discord.ac/)

[Discord.ac](https://discord.ac) is an unknown project that was created by [KBVE](https://kbve.com/) and friends :).


## Premise

### Init Goal.

The initial goal for this project is to develop a test case for our private cluster/cloud network but we might as well make it also a functional website. As for the bot that we shall be using, that will have its own [repo aka Discord.sh](https://github.com/kbve/discord.sh) or [Discord.sh Homepage](https://discord.sh). There has been some suggestions to build an advertising and/or marketing entity that expands outside of the normal discord eco-system, however we are still open to new ideas/concepts!

### Q4 2022 Soft Launch

For Q2/22 and Q3/22 the focus will be on the general ecosystem with the hopeful goal of having a soft launch near the end of this year. Granted, as we run into more issues, we may push the goal post further back. Also I am just typing more cr4p into here because I want to see how it renders through the bootstrap, so at this point, there is no need to continue to read. 


#### Current Timeline

* Setup `docker` files.
* Establish `bootstrap` static frontpage.
